# countdown-website

This is a website I made to solve the issue of my partner feeling down about her work schedule. The website features a countdown timer which counts down until the date her schedule changes to something more desirable! For the countdown timer, I used the JavaScript algorithm found at https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_countdown.asp. 

The website can be viewed at https://stirfry93.github.io/countdown-website/.
